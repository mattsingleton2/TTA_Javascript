Project listings and directories will be detailed below.

## Basic JavaScript Projects
This directory contains the basic JavaScript projects covered in The Tech Academy's JavaScript Course. 

Project Name  | Description
:---- | :---:
Project 1: Expressions  | This project covers the sheer basics of using javascript from an external file and linking it within another file. 
Project 2: Functions  | This project covers those ever-useful functions in javascript. Time to get a little more hands on about DOM manipulation.
Project 3: Math Operators | We get some practice with using operators in Javascript. I kept tying in some practice with HTML Events as well.
Project 4: Dictionaries | We practice utilizing Key-Value Pairs and displaying, manipulating and working with dictionaries / objects.
Project 5: Type Coercion and Comparisons | Using comparison operators and learning about type coercion - minimal js files with some examples of AND, OR, NOT, and how type coercion is used in Javascript since we're not strongly typing our variable data types.
Project 6: Ternary Operators & Constructors | Working with the ever-useful ternary operator. Like that ? Great, so do I : We'll agree to disagree! Constructors come into play here along with the 'this' keyword.
Project 7: Scope & Time function | Learning about code scope and time functions.
