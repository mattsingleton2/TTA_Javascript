# TTA_Javascript
JavaScript projects through The Tech Academy. This Repository will attempt to record, collect, and display any of my JavaScript practice, tutorial work and coursework. 
Project listings and directories will be detailed below.

## Project 1: Expressions
This project covers the sheer basics of using javascript from an external file and linking it within another file. 

## Project 2: Functions
This project covers those ever-useful functions in javascript. Time to get a little more hands on about DOM manipulation.
