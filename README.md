# The Tech Academy - JavaScript Course
JavaScript projects through The Tech Academy. This Repository will attempt to record, collect, and display any of my JavaScript practice, tutorial work and coursework. 
Project listings and directories will be detailed below.

## JavaScript Projects
This contains some practice with HTML5's Canvas Feature and some Form Validation requirement code for Javascript to help constrain HTML input values.

## Basic JavaScript Projects
This directory contains the basic JavaScript projects covered in The Tech Academy's JavaScript Course.

## Tic Tac Toe Game
This directory contains a rapid-fire tic tac toe game that uses HTML5 canvas to draw win lines and uses x, y coordinates for the squares. The X and O is just a background styling, but we update the selected squares into an array to keep track (for example 1x, 2o, 3o) and list out several (all of them, I hope) win conditions that's checked at the end of each move. Upon winning, a win line is drawn using HTML5 Canvas, and the images are removed, a win sound plays, and the array is re-instantiated to reset the game.

Project Name  | Description
:---- | :---:
Project 1: Expressions  | This project covers the sheer basics of using javascript from an external file and linking it within another file. 
Project 2: Functions  | This project covers those ever-useful functions in javascript. Time to get a little more hands on about DOM manipulation.
Project 3: Math Operators | We get some practice with using operators in Javascript. I kept tying in some practice with HTML Events as well.
Project 4: Dictionaries | We practice utilizing Key-Value Pairs and displaying, manipulating and working with dictionaries / objects.
Project 5: Type Coercion and Comparisons | Using comparison operators and learning about type coercion - minimal js files with some examples of AND, OR, NOT, and how type coercion is used in Javascript since we're not strongly typing our variable data types.
Project 6: Ternary Operators & Constructors | Working with the ever-useful ternary operator. Like that ? Great, so do I : We'll agree to disagree! Constructors come into play here along with the 'this' keyword.
Project 7: Scope & Time function | Learning about code scope and time functions.
Project 8: String Methods | Working with Javascript String Methods
Project 9: Countdown Slideshow | Putting things together...
Project 10: Loops & Arrays | Working on learning loops and arrays!
